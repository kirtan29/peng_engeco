Git Cheat Sheet (Beginner Friendly)
===================================

1. Check which branch you are on (should be 'main'):
   git branch --show-current

2. Update your local repo with the latest from GitHub:
   git pull origin main

3. Check what files changed since last commit:
   git status

4. Stage changes (choose one):
   git add .                # stage ALL changes
   git add filename.py      # stage one file only

5. Commit changes with a message:
   git commit -m "Your message here"

   Examples:
   git commit -m "Add pastpapers folder"
   git commit -m "Fix bug in finance function"
   git commit -m "Update README with instructions"

6. Push your changes to GitHub:
   git push origin main

âœ… Typical Daily Workflow:
cd path/to/your/project
git pull origin main
# make changes to files/folders
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
git push origin main

---

ðŸ“‚ Notes:
- Git does NOT track empty folders. Add a file (like .gitkeep) to keep them.
- Use short, clear commit messages describing your changes.
- If you want to save work temporarily without committing:
  git stash
  git pull origin main
  git stash pop
